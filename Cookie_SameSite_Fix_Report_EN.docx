Remediation Report for Security Issues

1. Missing Referrer-Policy Headers

Issue Description:
The application was missing the Referrer-Policy HTTP header, which may cause browsers to leak sensitive referrer information during cross-site requests, leading to information disclosure. (OWASP A05:2021)

Remediation Steps:
- JSP Workaround (Implemented):
  - Add the following line at the top of every JSP page:
    <% response.setHeader("Referrer-Policy", "no-referrer-when-downgrade"); %>
  - This ensures all dynamic pages include the recommended header.
- Java Filter (Recommended for long-term):
  - Implement a custom Java Filter to set the header for all responses (including static resources). Register the filter in web.xml.

Verification:
- Use browser dev tools or curl to check for:
  Referrer-Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade

Notes:
- JSP workaround only covers dynamic pages. For full coverage, use the filter approach.

2. Cookies Missing 'SameSite' Attributes

Issue Description:
According to the security audit report, the JSESSIONID cookie was missing the SameSite attribute, resulting in a potential CSRF risk.

Remediation Steps:
1. Modify Tomcat context.xml
   - Edit /appl/service/conf/context.xml
   - Add the following line inside the <Context ...> tag:
     <CookieProcessor sameSiteCookies="Lax"/>
2. Restart Tomcat
   - Execute /appl/service/scripts/restart.sh to apply the changes.
3. Verification
   - Use browser developer tools or Burp Suite to check the Set-Cookie header and confirm that JSESSIONID now includes SameSite=Lax.

Notes:
- Other TSxxxx cookies are generated by network devices (e.g., F5, CDN) and must be handled by the network/security team. These are not controlled by the application.

Result:
- The JSESSIONID cookie now correctly includes the SameSite attribute. This security issue has been resolved.
