Remediation Record for "Cookies Missing 'SameSite' Attributes"

1. Issue Description
According to the security audit report, the JSESSIONID cookie was missing the SameSite attribute, resulting in a potential CSRF risk.

2. Remediation Steps
1. Modify Tomcat context.xml
   - Edit /appl/service/conf/context.xml
   - Add the following line inside the <Context ...> tag:
     <CookieProcessor sameSiteCookies="Lax"/>
2. Restart Tomcat
   - Execute /appl/service/scripts/restart.sh to apply the changes.
3. Verification
   - Use browser developer tools or Burp Suite to check the Set-Cookie header and confirm that JSESSIONID now includes SameSite=Lax.

3. Notes
- Other TSxxxx cookies are generated by network devices (e.g., F5, CDN) and must be handled by the network/security team. These are not controlled by the application.

4. Result
- The JSESSIONID cookie now correctly includes the SameSite attribute. This security issue has been resolved.
